                    <h1>kindergarten</h1>
                    <p>I attended a kindergarten named Oo Yin Hmu Private School (2006/2007).(Now, the name has changed to Oo Yin Hmu Private High School).Actually, I was not happy going to kindergarten when I was young. I cried a lot and told the teachers that I wanted to go home every day. But my mom did give and take for me, like "if I go to school well, she'll give me the thing that I want". At that time, I was really like hello kitty stickers. Then it becomes the main reason that I want to go to school lol. I got a lot of stickers when I came back home and sometimes, I took the stickers to school and gave them to some of my favorite friends. Oh, why do I add this in my teenage part:') Anyway, I don't want to change anymore. And it was fun that the kindergarten did a lot of activities and the most unforgettable thing is I got the grand prize of the best students among over 200 children. That was the very first prize of my life, and I was 3 years old at that time. I felt the happiness of getting a prize and I really like the feeling of standing and taking the prize on the stage. From that time, I was greedy of being a clever student. </p>

                <p class="bbb"> I attended primary school at Pritacing Middle School Magway Education College. I really liked to go to school because I was in the same class with my bff. We're neighbors and our families are also close to each other. Then I found another bff at my primary school. We're still bff now, like over 18 years-friendship when I was 21. When we met each other first, it was such a childish thing lol, we're not in a good relationship. We have a lot of conflicts even for just a little thing. But that's what it is. We can still maintain that roller-coaster relationship. My friends often come to my home and stay about 1 week or sometimes 10 days. Those  were the happiest memory of my life. We mostly played barbie and princess games. (ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥Î°ú Í≥µÏ£ºÎ≥ë? ÏïÑÏßÅÎèÑ Ï°∞Í∏à ÎÇ®ÏïÑÏûàÏùå „Öã„Öã„Öã) And it became the start of my trio journey. </p>
