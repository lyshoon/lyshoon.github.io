                    <p>I attended a kindergarten named Oo Yin Hmu Private School (2006/2007).(Now, the name has changed to Oo Yin Hmu Private High School).Actually, I was not happy going to kindergarten when I was young. I cried a lot and told the teachers that I wanted to go home every day. But my mom did give and take for me, like "if I go to school well, she'll give me the thing that I want". At that time, I was really like hello kitty stickers. Then it becomes the main reason that I want to go to school lol. I got a lot of stickers when I came back home and sometimes, I took the stickers to school and gave them to some of my favorite friends. Oh, why do I add this in my teenage part:') Anyway, I don't want to change anymore. And it was fun that the kindergarten did a lot of activities and the most unforgettable thing is I got the grand prize of the best students among over 200 children. That was the very first prize of my life, and I was 3 years old at that time. I felt the happiness of getting a prize and I really like the feeling of standing and taking the prize on the stage. From that time, I was greedy of being a clever student. </p>

                <p class="bbb"> I attended primary school at Pritacing Middle School Magway Education College. I really liked to go to school because I was in the same class with my bff. We're neighbors and our families are also close to each other. Then I found another bff at my primary school. We're still bff now, like over 18 years-friendship when I was 21. When we met each other first, it was such a childish thing lol, we're not in a good relationship. We have a lot of conflicts even for just a little thing. But that's what it is. We can still maintain that roller-coaster relationship. My friends often come to my home and stay about 1 week or sometimes 10 days. Those  were the happiest memory of my life. We mostly played barbie and princess games. (한국어로 공주병? 아직도 조금 남아있음 ㅋㅋㅋ) And it became the start of my trio journey.</p>

                <p class="ccc"> When I finished my primary school,I changed to the MEC Private High School.I attended from grade-5 to grade-8 there. And I changed there with one of my friends. Yep we're match to each other because we've a little same personality. She's now in Singapore and we haven't met each other for a long time, miss u too. I was afraid of people since I was young. So, I can't go everywhere without my close friend.🥲 I made a very few friends in middle school and the worst time of weak social. But I love being trio though. I've got the permit to add her name now :xD. The one I told who is with over 18 years friendship, her name is Shin and we also attended middle school together. Actually, she's better in social more than me. Actually I have a lot of memories in middle school. Firstly, I started like Kpop. They're EXO and Baekhyun is my favourite one. I was in a sweet life every day because of him. I don't know why but at that time, I was really excited when I see his face or when I listen his songs. I was really^1000000 crazy over him when I was 12. At that time, I thought I'll marry him when I get older lmao. (The main reason why I choose Korea for study abroad. Childish thoughts) When I think about that now, Baekhyun oppa was the main reason why I didn't get boyfriend. I thought about him every night, every time and, no one in front of me cannot be seen. Omg How can I like him so many years lol. It's about 7 years. I spent all of my teenager love over him. Guys don't be like me, it's so unrealistic. You can't get or marry idols lol. And you can also abandon the person who really like you:"). Yep, I spent my teenager life with study and idols. (아니 백현이 아직도 넘 키여워ㅠㅠ 사진 찾으러 갔는데 설레고 돌아옴)

                <p class="ddd">As I told above, Family Time!!!. The place I've changed a lot. I have to communicate with the students from all over the country and first time of living without parents. Especially, I can change my personality a lot. I was afraid I can't live adopted before I've enter Family. But it went well. I met my bestie May Thu from there and got the best friendship. We're like sisters now 🫶🏻. Moreover, I met a lot of good friends and remember all of u guys 🤍. In high school, my personality changed to a little extrovert and I can start communicate with new people and strangers. (Actually I'm ambivert lol. I enjoy playing a lot with some people whom I can feel comfortable with them. At that time, I'm totally another person. But with strangers or new people or people who aren't correct with me, even one word can't come, and I feel very exhausted spending time with them. And I can't also go to the place where a lot of people are. I feel like I was taking my energy away. ) Well, as it is high school, the first priority is study and also the second, third and last are study. I passed my matriculation examination with high marks. That's all. 🧸 </p>
