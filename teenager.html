                    <h1>kindergarten</h1>
                    <p>I attended a kindergarten named Oo Yin Hmu Private School (2006/2007).(Now, the name has changed to Oo Yin Hmu Private High School).Actually, I was not happy going to kindergarten when I was young. I cried a lot and told the teachers that I wanted to go home every day. But my mom did give and take for me, like "if I go to school well, she'll give me the thing that I want". At that time, I was really like hello kitty stickers. Then it becomes the main reason that I want to go to school lol. I got a lot of stickers when I came back home and sometimes, I took the stickers to school and gave them to some of my favorite friends. Oh, why do I add this in my teenage part:') Anyway, I don't want to change anymore. And it was fun that the kindergarten did a lot of activities and the most unforgettable thing is I got the grand prize of the best students among over 200 children. That was the very first prize of my life, and I was 3 years old at that time. I felt the happiness of getting a prize and I really like the feeling of standing and taking the prize on the stage. From that time, I was greedy of being a clever student. </p>
